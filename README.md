# google-clone-light

This is another website to practice my HTML and CSS. This time, I created a clone of Google's homepage in Light mode. 

My goal with this site was to use basic CSS grid mixed with HTML. This is my first use of grid. I am getting much quicker at creating single page websites. I can better select many elements without extra classes. 

I've also been able to simplify the media queries for this site, as my spacing of elements has improved greatly.
